  <h3>Estimation Details</h3>
  <p>
    Somewhat surprisingly, there is very little research about the amount of time it takes the average college student to complete common academic tasks.
    We have self-reported estimates of how much total time they spend on academic work outside of class (12-15 hours), but we don’t know much about the 
    quality and quantity of the work that is produced in that time frame (let alone how the time is allocated to different tasks). We also know quite a 
    bit about how students tackle common academic tasks, but those studies rarely ask students to report on how long it takes them to complete the task 
    (whether reading a book, writing a paper, or studying for an exam). The testing literature provides some clues (because valid instrument design depends on 
    data about the average speed of test takers), but it’s tough to generalize from the experience of taking high-stakes, timed tests to the experience of working 
    on an assignment in the comfort of your dorm. And while there is a sizable literature on reading, the nature and purpose of the reading tasks in these experiments 
    are also quite different from what students typically encounter in college.

  <ul>
    <li>The optimal reading rate of the skilled adult reader (including college students) is around 300 words per minute. This assumes a “normal” reading environment in which there are no new words or concepts in the text and the purpose of the reading is to understand the meaning of each sentence (Rayner et al., 2016; Carver, 1982).</li>
    <li>Adults can read faster than 300 words per minute, but if the goal is to understand the meaning of sentences, rates beyond 300 words per minute reduce comprehension in a near linear fashion (Zacks and Treiman, 2016; Love, 2012; Carver, 1982).</li>
    <li>The default reading rates of college students under these normal conditions can range from 100-400 words per minute (Rayner et al., 2016; Siegenthaler et al., 2011; Acheson et al., 2008; Carver, 1982, 1983, 1992; Underwood et al., 1990; Hausfeld, 1981; Just and Carpenter, 1980; Jay and Dahl, 1975; Grob, 1970; McLaughlin, 1969; Robinson and Hall, 1941). </li>
    <li>There is no real upper limit on skimming speeds, but the average college student skims for main ideas at rates between 450 and 600 words per minute (Rayner et al., 2016; Carver 1992; Just and Carpenter, 1980; Jay and Dahl, 1975)</li>
    <li>In conditions where the material is more difficult (i.e., with some new words and concepts), the optimal reading rate slows to 200 words per minute (Carver, 1992).</li>
    <li>In conditions where the purpose is to memorize the text for later recall, the optimal reading rate slows even further to 138 words per minute or lower (Carver, 1992).</li>
    <li>Although this has not been measured (to our knowledge), reading experts have argued that it is perfectly reasonable to slow down to rates below 50 words per minute if the goal is to engage a text (Parker, 1962).</li>

  
  </ul>
  <h3>Source and Methodology</h3>
  <p>
    This calculator and methodology is based on the <strong>Workload Estimator 2.0</strong>, developed by Wake Forest University.
    It uses the same research-backed measurements for estimating reading and writing time.
  </p>
  <p>
    These estimates are informed by studies on student performance across various factors, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Page density</li>
    <li>Text difficulty</li>
    <li>Reading purpose</li>
    <li>Drafting and revision effort</li>
    <li>Text genre (e.g., narrative, argument, research)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The methodology reflects the time real students typically spend under different academic conditions.
  </p>
<h3>Exam Calculation</h3>
<p>The study time for exams is calculated by finding the average amount of time the student is expected to study over the course 
    of the semester. This calculation is: (Exams * Hours of Expected Study) / Course Duration
